# Basic Frontend

This frontend-only asset canister allows you to serve static files without a backend canister.
Asset canisters can be used to serve static frontend files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, to users through a web browser.

## Project structure

The `/frontend` folder contains web assets for the application's user interface. The user interface is written using the React framework.
